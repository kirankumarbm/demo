REAL TIME VIDEO STREAMING IN VEHICULAR AD HOC NETWORKS

Real time video streams which capture road conditions
 can enhance road safety and improve traffic efficiency.

This project aims at reducing the traffic congestion 
by streaming live video of the accident site 
for the vehicles approaching the accident location.

We developed a system in which one vehicle informs 
the other vehicles about accidents that happened 
prior they reach the place of accident causing more traffic congestion.

 The vehicle in the front having a camera captures the scene of 
the accident site based on the result of a machine learning model. 
Once it detects an accident a live video stream will be sent
 to the vehicle preceding it which cannot see the accident scene.

 Once the vehicle gets the live video it can take an alternate path
 if it exists before it reaches the place of accident and hence can avoid the traffic congestion. 

We have used socket programming for video transmission,
 with which the vehicles receive a live video stream of
 the accident site with a delay less than 150ms.
 The machine learning model used is Mobilenet SSD, which gives high accuracy 
in object detection and is basically used for low computational devices like Raspberry Pi.
